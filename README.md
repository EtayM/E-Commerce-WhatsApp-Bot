## Overview

We operate an e-commerce-centric WhatsApp bot that assists **consumers** with:

- **Finding Better Deals**: Users send a product link or description, and we attempt to locate the same product at a lower price from other retailers.  
- **Curated Product Lists**: Personalized or seasonal shopping suggestions (e.g., birthday gift ideas, Halloween costumes).  
- **Product Recommendations**: If a user describes an item (e.g., “red sweater under \$50”), we provide relevant offers from supported e-commerce platforms.

This project aims to provide a **helpful, transparent, and user-focused** experience in compliance with WhatsApp’s Business Terms of Service, WhatsApp Business Messaging Policy, and local laws.
